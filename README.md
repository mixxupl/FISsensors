# FISsensors

- reading 4 read and 4 front sensors

- posible 2 dead angle sensors at side back bumper

- rear sensors initialized by 12V from reverse lights

- front sensors initialized when speed is under 10km/h? (need to know how to read speed signal/gala on radio??)

- 2

questions:

- it will be one MCU for both or 2mcus ?, one controling front sensors and sending just data over serial to mcu which will draw on FIS?

- dead-angle sensors can use HW for back sensors if we are not parking, or we should use them as well while parking?


youtube demo showing rendering speed, front is quicker then rear ....
